# study_buddy
This Arduino project uses a photoresistor and OLED display to help you achieve the perfect lighting for studying. With friendly robot eyes that respond to light levels, this project combines functionality and fun, making it an ideal study companion! 

How It Works: The project measures the light level in your study area using a photoresistor. If the light is bright enough—above a threshold of 650—the robot eyes on the OLED display "wake up," blink, and stay open, signaling that the lighting is ideal for studying. If the light level falls below 650, the eyes go into "sleep mode," staying closed to let you know that the room could use more light for better focus. 
 
Why This Project? Good lighting is essential for productive studying, as it can improve focus and reduce eye strain. With this simple and interactive project, you’ll have an instant indicator of whether your study space is well-lit. Instead of relying on guesswork, you can just glance at the friendly robot eyes on your OLED display—they’ll let you know if it’s time to study or if you need more light.
